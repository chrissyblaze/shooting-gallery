The sounds.py file is being run automatically on startup from the
/etc/rc.local script, and logging to the sounds.log file in this directory.

To see if it's running:
ps auxw | grep python

To kill it if you need to:
run the ps as above to find the 'pid' (process id), then you can run
sudo kill -9 <pid>

To monitor the end of the log file:
tail -f sounds.log
